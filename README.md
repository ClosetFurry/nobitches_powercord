# no-bitches-plugin

A simple Powercord plugin that allows you to quickly send 'no bitches?' memes with custom text by using a command. Once the plugin is installed just select the nobitches command, type your caption, hit enter and it will automatically send a https://api.no-bitch.es/ link that will embed into your meme

This plugin is inspired by [ClosetFurry/nobitches_powercord](https://github.com/ClosetFurry/nobitches_powercord). Unlike that repo, my fork actually supports most characters (such as `?`, `!`, `#`, `;`, `\`, etc.) instead of just spaces

# Installation

The easiest way is to send https://github.com/Flower-178/no-bitches-plugin somewhere inside Discord, then right click the link and there should be an option to install the plugin in the context menu (you might have to right click twice, like me in the preview below, I blame the caching)

You can also clone this repo to your plugins folder with git instead

...or manually copy and paste the files into your plugins folder

### Todo
1. Make versions for other client mods
2. Rewrite the plugin again...?
