# no-bitches-plugin

A simple Powercord plugin that allows you to quickly send 'no bitches?' memes with custom text by using a command. Once the plugin is installed just select the nobitches command, type your caption, hit enter and it will automatically send a https://api.no-bitch.es/ link that will embed into your meme

This plugin is inspired by [ClosetFurry/nobitches_powercord](https://github.com/ClosetFurry/nobitches_powercord). Unlike that repo, my fork actually supports most characters (such as `?`, `!`, `#`, `;`, `\`, etc.) instead of just letters and spaces

# Installation

The easiest way is to send https://github.com/Flower-178/no-bitches-plugin somewhere inside Discord, then right click the link and there should be an option to install the plugin in the context menu (you might have to right click twice, I blame the caching)

You can also clone this repo with git instead

...or manually download/copy and paste the files

### Todo
1. Make it so that if no caption is provided plugin sends the 'default' no bitches meme
2. Make versions for other client mods
